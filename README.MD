# sortfiles

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files in a directory into folders based on their file types.  
If a file type is not recognized, it will be placed in the `others` folder.

## Features
- Sorts files into categories such as `images`, `documents`, `spreadsheets`, `presentation`, `audio`, `video`, `archives`, `code`
- Automatically creates the target folders if they don't exist
- Puts unknown file types into an `others` folder
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
